# isGoose
"What would you say if I told you there is an app on the market that would tell you if you have a goose or not a goose?" - Jian-Yang

Run

```
python isGooseTest.py
```
and enter the path to your jpg file when prompted, such as:

```
isGoose.jpg
```

to see if the picture contains a Canadian Goose!

On the validation set, the neural network had a 75% accuracy recognizing geese and a 55% accuracy recognizing non-geese images. As expected, it is much easier to figure out if something is a goose than otherwise, as the subset of not goose is much larger than the subset of goose!
